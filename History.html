	<h2>C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.</h2>
	<p>An example of C# code is a tool that generates <a href="http://www.sanfoundry.com/csharp-program-generates-randam-numbers/" target="_blank">random numbers</a></p>
	<p>C# is compiled into IL(an Intermediate Language), by the c# compiler. This IL is then compiled just-in-time (JIT) as it's needed, into the native assembly language of the host machine. It would be possible to write a .NET runtime that interpreted the IL instead though. </p>
	<p>C# is a weakly typed language. The difference between a strongly typed language and a weakly typed language is basically that a strongly typed language checks the type of a variable before performing an operation on it, whereas a weakly typed language does not.</p>
	<p>Classified as strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. </p>
